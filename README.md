Explanation:

1. **Normal State Styles (a)**:
   - `color: black;`: Sets the text color of the link to black.
   - `text-decoration: none;`: Removes the underline from the link.

2. **Hover State Styles (a:hover)**:
   - `color: orangered;`: Changes the text color to orangered when the link is hovered.
   - `background-color: black;`: Sets the background color to black when the link is hovered.

These styles create a simple and common hover effect for a link, where the text color changes to orangered and the background color changes to black when the user hovers over the link. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
